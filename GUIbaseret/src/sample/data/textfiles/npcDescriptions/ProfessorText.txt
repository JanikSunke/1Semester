Hello! I am a professor here at SDU, and currently investigating where in our nature most plastic waste end up.
Here at SDU we have a good recycle system for our plastic garbage, so you will not find any laying around here.
Most plastic usually end up around the coast, maybe you should try visiting the east-coast.
Ohh! I should visit the beach then.
Alright. I have to get back to work. Bye!

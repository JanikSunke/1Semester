Hello and welcome to SDU! I am here to help you. I heard that you're looking for plastic. Here at SDU we have a good recycle system for our plastic garbage. But I might have some helpful information.
Did you know that most plastic usually ends up around the coast or in the park.
Maybe you should try investigating those areas. I'm sure you will find something.
Alright. I have to get back to work. Good luck!

Hello! I am a professor here at SDU, and currently studing where there are most plastic in the nature.
Here at SDU we have a good recycle system for our plastic garbage.
Did you know that most plastic usually ends up around the coast, Maybe you should try investigating those areas.
Thanks, i will do that.
Alright. I have to get back to work. Bye!

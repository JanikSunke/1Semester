Oh no, the machine has broken down.
You will need to repair the machine to complete the road.
I have contacted a good fellow in the town and he is a mechanic. He wants to help us.
Okay I will go look for him!
Hey come over here!
Hello, first of all good job! Collecting the plastic around will make big difference for the nature environment.
But before you get started i want to give you some information about our project.
Plastic roads can be made partly using plastic and normal roads or out of 100% plastic.
In this road we replace asphalt with plastic and make a combination of plastic and what
we know from a normal road. The sticky substance in asphalt can be replaced with the plastic.
Your job is to collect as much plastic you can as fast as possible.
Okay! Let's build a road!

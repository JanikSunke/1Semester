Oh no, the machine has broken down.
You will need to repair the machine to complete the road.
I have contacted a good fellow in the town and he is a mechanic. He wants to help us.
Okay I will go look for him!
Hey come over here!
Hello! I think it's very nice of you to help the local environment by collecting plastic for the road.
But before you get started i want to give you some information about our project.
Plastic roads can be made of partly plastic and normal roads or 100% plastic
In this road we replace asphalt with plastic and make a combination of plastic and what
we know from a normal road. The sticky substance in asphalt can be replaced with the plastic.

Oh no, the machine has broken down.
You will need to repair the machine to complete the road.
I have contacted a good fellow in the town and he is a mechanic. He wants to help us.
Okay I will go look for him!
Hey come over here!
Hello! I think it's very nice of you to help the local environment by collecting plastic for us.
But before you get started i want to give you some information about our project.
Plastic roads can either be made out of 100% plastic or partly by replacing
by replacing the sticky substance in asphalt with plastic.
In this road we replace asphalt with plastic and make a combination of a plastic and a normal road.

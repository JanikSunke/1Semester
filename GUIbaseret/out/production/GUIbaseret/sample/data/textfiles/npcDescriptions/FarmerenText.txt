Plastic takes a lot of years to decompose in the nature. Therefore i collect the plastic i find around the Farm, 
so it can be used for a better purpose.
Would you like to get some plastic I have collected on my farm?
Yes please. I am collecting plastic for the road project between the town and the coast.
Is it really possible to build road using plastic waste?
Yes, we got the idea from a company in California.
That sounds great, i will give you the plastic i have collected!
You dont have enough space in your inventory. Go to the roadbuilder and empty your inventory first.

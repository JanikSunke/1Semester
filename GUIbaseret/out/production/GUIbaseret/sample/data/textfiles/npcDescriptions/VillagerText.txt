Hello! I heard that your machine broke down. I'm a mechanic and might be able to help you out.
I'm a little tied up right now, but I have a spare toolkit that you guys can borrow if you wish to?
It could be nice if I could borrow that. Thanks.
Here you go good luck with getting the machine up and running again!

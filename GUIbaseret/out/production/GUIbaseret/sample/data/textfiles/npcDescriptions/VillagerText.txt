Hello! I heard that your machine broke down. I'm a mechanic and might be able to help you out.
I'm a little tied up right now, but I have a spare toolkit that you guys can borrow if you wish to?
It would be a great help to borrow that. Thanks!
Here you go and good luck with getting the machine up and running again!
Sorry I can't talk now, I'm busy!
